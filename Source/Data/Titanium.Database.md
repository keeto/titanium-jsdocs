Titanium.Database {#Titanium.Database}
======================================

> The Titanium.Database object does not exist in Titanium PR2. Local database stores are implemented using the HTML5 Client-side Database Storage implementation by Webkit. For more information, please visit the documentation for that implementation [here](http://webkit.org/blog/126/webkit-does-html5-client-side-database-storage/).
> Future releases of Titanium will have a Titanium.Database API, which shall wrap the native webkit implementation of HTML5 Database Store and also provide additional features for it.
